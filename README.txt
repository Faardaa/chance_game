# 50% Luck Game

Welcome to the "50% Luck Game" project! This simple Python program is designed as a game of chance to test your knowledge of the Pandas and NumPy libraries. The game involves making random choices and determining your winnings based on those choices.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the "50_percent_luck_game.py" file to start the game.

3. You will start with an initial amount of $1, which will increase as you win.

4. The game presents a 10x10 grid where each cell contains either "Missed" or "Won" at random.

5. You'll be prompted to choose a column (1 to 10) and a row (1 to 10) from the grid.

6. Depending on your selection, the program will tell you whether you've "Won" or "Missed" a prize.

7. If you win, your earnings will increase by $1, and you can choose to play again with your new winnings or leave the game with your current earnings.

8. If you lose, your earnings will reset to $0, and you can choose to start over or exit the game.

## Project Structure

- `50_percent_luck_game.py`: The main Python script that runs the game.
- `README.md`: This README file, providing instructions and information about the project.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `random`: To generate random outcomes.
- `numpy` (NumPy): For array operations and reshaping.
- `pandas` (Pandas): For working with data sets and creating a grid.

## Disclaimer

This project is created solely for educational purposes and as a personal project to test knowledge of Pandas and NumPy. It is not intended to be a fully-fledged game but rather a coding exercise.
